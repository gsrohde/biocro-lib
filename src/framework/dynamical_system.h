/**
 *  @class dynamical_system
 *
 *  @brief Defines a dynamical system which can be solved using an ode_solver.
 *
 *  A dynamical system requires three elements:
 *
 *  - A state space, which may generally be thought of as consisting of one or
 *    more quantities; here we use the term _quantity_ to refer to a named
 *    variable that represents some particular attribute of the state.
 *
 *  - An independent quantity upon which the value of the state depends, which
 *    is typically taken to be the time.
 *
 *  - An evolution rule which describes how to determine the value of the state
 *    at a future time given its value at the current time.
 *
 *  This class (together with a differential equation solver) represents a
 *  dynamical system. It defines the following:
 *
 *  - The quantities that comprise the state. These are determined from the
 *    parameters, drivers, direct modules, and differential modules.
 *
 *  - The independent quantity. This is assumed to be _time_.
 *
 *  - The equations required to calculate the values of the parameters, drivers,
 *    and direct quantities (which are all elements of the state), given values
 *    of the differential quantities (another subset of the state) and the time.
 *    The equations for the parameters set them equal to constants. The
 *    equations for the drivers are determined by interpolating the supplied
 *    discrete values. The equations for the direct quantities are supplied by
 *    the direct modules.
 *
 *  - The equations required to calculate the derivatives of the differential
 *    quantities, given the values of the state and the time. These equations
 *    are supplied by the differential modules.
 *
 *  - The initial values of the differential quantities.
 *
 *  To fully define the evolution rule, it is also necessary to supply a
 *  differential equation solver in addition to the equations mentioned above.
 *  Such solvers are provided as another class: the `ode_solver`.
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  One key property of this class is its private data member `all_quantities`.
 *  This `state_map` represents the current state of a dynamical system, i.e.,
 *  it specifies the names and values of all quantities that comprise the state.
 *  When a `dynamical_system` object's direct modules are run, they read
 *  quantity values from `all_quantities` and store calculated quantity values
 *  in it; when a `dynamical_system` object's differential modules are run, they
 *  also read quantity values from `all_quantities`. In that sense, it is a sort
 *  of "central clearing house" for quantities. It is sometimes referred to as
 *  the "internally stored quantity map" or "internally stored map." The
 *  individual quantities that comprise `all_quantities` are sometimes referred
 *  to as "internally stored quantities," and their values may be called
 *  "internally stored quantity values."
 *
 *  In addition to the `all_quantities` data member, there is a separate private
 *  data member for storing the outputs from the differential modules; this
 *  `state_map` is called `differential_quantity_derivatives`. This member is
 *  sometimes also referred to as the "internally stored map," and it should be
 *  clear from context that derivatives of quantity values, rather than quantity
 *  values themselves, are being referenced.
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Public methods are provided that allow access to the values or names of
 *  subsets of `all_quantities` and `differential_quantity_derivatives`:
 *
 *  - `get_differential_quantity_names` returns the names of the differential
 *    quantities
 *
 *  - `get_differential_quantities` returns the values of the differential
 *    quantities
 *
 *  - `calculate_derivative` calculates the derivatives of each of the
 *    differential quantities given values for the time and the differential
 *    quantities
 *
 *  - `get_output_quantity_names` returns the names of all quantities that are
 *    expected to change throughout a simulation, i.e., the drivers, direct
 *    quantities, and differential quantities (but not the parameters)
 *
 *  - `get_quantity_access_ptrs` returns pointers to elements of all_quantities
 *    that correspond to quantity names that are supplied in the input argument
 *
 *  - `update_all_quantities` determines the values of all state quantities from
 *    input values of time and the differential quantities; this function
 *    modifies `all_quantities` but has no return value
 *
 *  - `reset` returns all quantities to their initial values, as if the
 *    `dynamical_system` object had just been created; this may be helpful if an
 *    object is to be reused for multiple simulations; this function
 *    modifies `all_quantities` but has no return value
 *
 *  When using a differential equation solver to determine the time evolution of
 *  a dynamical system's state, it is typically necessary to treat the values of
 *  the differential quantities as a vector where they take a particular order,
 *  in contrast to our usual method of storing quantities in `state_map` objects
 *  where their values are accessed via their names and do not have a defined
 *  order. In this situation, the `get_differential_quantity_names` and
 *  `get_differential_quantities` methods are essential, since they return the
 *  names and values of the differential quantities in a defined order. When the
 *  `calculate_derivative` method is called, the values of the differential
 *  quantities are expected to be supplied in the same order defined by
 *  `get_differential_quantity_names`, and the derivatives are also returned in
 *  that order.
 *
 *  Once a time sequence of differential quantity values has been determined by
 *  a solver, it is typically necessary to retrieve the values of all state
 *  quantities that change during a simulation. This can be achieved using
 *  additional public methods. First, the names of all such quantities can be
 *  determined using the `get_output_quantity_names` method. Then, pointers to
 *  the values of these quantities in the central map can be obtained using the
 *  `get_quantity_access_ptrs` method. Finally, for each value of time and the
 *  differential quantities, the `update_all_quantities` method can be called to
 *  update `all_quantities`, and the access pointers can be used to retrieve the
 *  updated values from `all_quantities`. Rather than explicitly calling these
 *  methods, this procedure can be performed using the `get_results_from_system`
 *  free function.
