/**
 * @brief Various physical constants are collected here.
 *
 * These physical constants may be subdivided according to how
 * "constant" they are:
 *
 * - `stefan_boltzmann` and `ideal_gas_constant`: These are truly
 * constant, and as of the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, they
 * have exact numerical values when expressed in SI units.
 *
 * - `molar_mass_of_water` and other molar masses: These depend on the relative
 * frequency of the molecule's isotopologues, but for practical purposes, and
 * because the composition doesn't usually vary greatly, we treat the molar
 * masses as constant with the approximate values given.
 *
 * - `atmospheric_pressure_at_sea_level`: More precisely, this is
 * **standard sea-level pressure**, which has the value given here _by
 * definition_ and represents the near-average atmospheric pressure at
 * sea level on the Earth.  The actual atmospheric pressure at any
 * sea-level location changes continuously over time and may vary
 * considerably from this.
 *
 * - `dr_boundary` and `dr_stomata`: These are diffusivity ratios of H2O and CO2
 * (D_H2O / D_CO2) in the boundary layer and stomata, respectively. The
 * diffusivity of H2O is larger since the molecules are smaller. These values
 * are estimated from different conductance mechanisms in the associated
 * regions. The true values might not be constant, but they are commonly
 * treated as being constant. For more information, see the discussion following
 * Equation B16 in
 * [von Caemmerer & Farquhar "Some relationships between the biochemistry of
 * photosynthesis and the gas exchange of leaves. Planta 153, 376â€“387 (1981)]
 * (http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00384257).
